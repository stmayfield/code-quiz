# 04-Web-APIs: Interactive Code Quiz 

This website sources HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap CDN, and 2 custom .svg images to create short quiz that utlizies as much DOM manipulation as possible. The trivia in this game is themed after the popular film franchise... "Shrek".

Improvements/Bugs Identified:

- getLocalStorage functionalty grabs and displays inputed name and score, but does not currently save to local storage to access and display other scores afterward.

- A Retry function was started, but does not perform as intended

- General code consolidation and cleanup is needed to improve performance and extend flexibility

- Score tracker is functional but flawed, as it will always grant a point for each correct answer regardless of the number of guesses.
